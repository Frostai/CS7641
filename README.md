### Datasets:

- [Poker hands](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand)
- [MADELON](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Madelon)

### How to run - Supervised Learning

- To run, install numpy, pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib
- Run independent scripts for madelon_data.py or poker_data.py, optional, 
  there are jupyter notebooks, but the dataset urls do not work relative from a remote jupyter server (my case).
- Should generate plots in same directory.


### How to run - Randomized optimization
- To run, install numpy, pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib
- From a terminal inside the randomized_optimization folder run:
    python3 ./flipflop.py
    python3 ./n_queens.py
    python3 ./six_peaks.py
    python3 ./optimization_dnn.py
- Should generate plots in same directory.
- NOTE: Some plots take a REALLY LONG time to create so they are commented.
