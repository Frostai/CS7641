### Datasets:

- [Poker hands](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand)
- [MADELON](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Madelon)

### How to run

- To run, install numpy, pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib
- Run independent scripts for madelon_data.py or poker_data.py, optional, 
  there are jupyter notebooks, but the dataset urls do not work relative from a remote jupyter server (my case).
- Should generate plots in same directory.
